# a_random_quote_generator-v1
## Introduction
Treehouse Unit 2 Project. This application presents a list of students in a hard-coded ```data.js``` file. A pagination feature and a 'real-time' search function is added to the application.

## Tech Stack
HTML/CSS. JavaScript.

## Process/Learning (to be updated)
1. Dom Manipulation
2. Array iteration methods
3. Pagination
4. Event listeners and event handlers
5. DRYing and refactoring

## Improvement
Could implement a database or maybe a fetch API for real-world application. Could add a modal feature.

## Running the Project
Clone the project, and simply open ```index.html```
<br /> Otherwise, I have a live version [here](https://crooks-s.github.io/data-pagination-and-filtering-v1/).
