# data-pagination-and-filtering-v1
Team Treehouse Unit 2 Project

This is a Team Treehouse project demonstrating:

1. Dom Manipulation
2. Array iteration methods
3. Pagination
4. Event listeners and event handlers
5. DRYing and refactoring

- This application presents a list of students that are stored in data.js. 
- A pagination feature was added to show 9 students per page. 
- Real-time search functionality was added to the search bar by making a 'keyup' event listener.
